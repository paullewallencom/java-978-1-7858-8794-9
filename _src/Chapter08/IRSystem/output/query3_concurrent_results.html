<h2>35367467.txt: ABCD: Any Body Can Dance: 24.77</h2><p>After having a bitter disagreement with his friend and manager Jehangir Khan (Kay Kay Menon) about the latters blatant abuse of power and influence to win a dance competition called "Dance Dil Se" for his team JDC (Jehangir Dance Company), the choreographer of the dance company, Vishnu (Prabhu Deva), quits his job. At first he wants to return home to Chennai, but his friend Gopi (Ganesh Acharya) persuades him to stay in Mumbai with him. One day, he observes several young men using parkour to evade the police. They turn out to be proteges of Gopi, but despite their obvious raw talent, they lack the discipline required to become serious artists; they demonstrate this disastrously at a local event for a politician, wherein they set the stage on fire. After witnessing the same young men showing their dancing abilities at Ganpati Chaturthi to beat their rival neighborhood, Vishnu decides to start his own dance group with them; ultimately preparing them to compete in "Dance Dil Se". However, the lack of discipline among the dancers and the rivalry between the two factions in the group lead by D (Dharmesh Yelande) and Rocky (Salman Yusuff Khan) leads to multiple creative and emotional blocks. Initially, only Rocky and his gang are willing to attend the free classes, but soon D and his friends gravitate towards the studio.</p><p>Despite repeated pleas for peace in the studio, the two main gangs continue to clash, driving Vishnu to his wits end. However, the students seem to improve and as a reward, he gives them money to buy new speakers, but they nearly lose it all when Rhea takes them to an elite dance club and challenge the resident champions, a professional dance crew called "Fictitious Crew". Vishnu arrives at the last minute and wins back the money, but while his students gain new respect for him, he is furious with them. After some hard apologizing, he forgives them and they return to class with greater discipline and drive, only to suddenly be thrown out on the street after Ds father calls the cops. During all of this Rocky and Rhea start to fall for each other whilst D burns with jealousy. The community complains that their children should not be mixing in such a way and only through an impromptu dance performance are the youth able to convince their families of the importance of their talent. Only Ds orthodox Muslim father refused to accept that his son desires to be a dancer.</p><p>The crew head to Dance Dil Se and audition, but when Rocky and D fight onstage for Rhea, their chances of appearing on the show in the first place seem bleak. Jehangir, in a bid to humiliate Vishnu publicly, persuades the judges to take the "Dhongri Dance Revolution" crew on as a "comedy act". Faced with ridicule and the idea that they are a joke and not true dancers, Vishnu asks Rocky and D to do a step that requires a great deal of trust for both, but they cannot muster the trust to manage it. Vishnu has them choose the people they would trust to perform the step with, but then tricks both dancers by blindfolding them and having them attempt it again; this time, they are successful, and the two factions begin to trust each other and work together. Not long before the finals, Chandu prepares to propose to Shaina, but he meets his old drug dealer on the street. Now completely free from the hold of drugs, he refuses to fall back into that world, but the dealer, irritated, knocks the ring intended for Shaina into the street. As he retrieves it, Chandu is hit by a truck and killed, leaving the team devastated. Shaina, though barely able to stand from grief, becomes the centerpiece of the teams semi-final routine, in which they express the loss of their friend, bringing audience members to tears. The team and the community come together to bury Chandu, and DDR resolves to continue in the competition in his memory. At the finals, Jehangir pulls a dirty trick: his informant Mayur (a performer in DDR but, tempted by Jehangirs offer of a main lead role in JDC began to feed information to the opposition) has ordered his dancers to copy the rival teams choreography and performance concept. Faced with losing, DDR crafts a new routine on the spot, based around Lord Ganesha. Their heartfelt and spontaneous performance reminds the cold-hearted Jehangir why he and Vishnu started JDC in the first place and is humbled as the DDR crew are rewarded with thunderous applause and victory in the competition.</p>

<h2>3278100.txt: 3 Ninjas Kick Back: 19.82</h2><p>Rocky, Colt and Tum-Tum are experiencing the pains of growing up prior to a trip to Japan planned with their grandfather Mori Shintaro, who hopes to take them to a martial arts tournament of which he was the victor 50 years ago. Only Tum-Tum seems interested in going, and even then, only out of interest in seeing sumo wrestlers due to how much food they get to eat. He tells the boys he hopes to return a dagger awarded to him at the tournament when he defeated a boy named Koga, so that it may be presented to the incumbent victor. In Japan, a man (later revealed to be Koga) breaks into a museum and steals a sword before escaping via hang glider. Meanwhile, back at Moris house, a trio of bunglers led by Kogas nephew Glam try to break into the house to steal the dagger, the boys manage to drive them off, counting it as an ordinary robbery attempt.</p><p>At a baseball game, Rocky seems focused on a cute girl named Lisa D.

Tum-Tum causes constant breaks due to getting snacks, and Colts short temper causes a fight with the opposing team that grows so large that the umpire calls off the game until the next week, driving a nail into the boys plans to travel. Grandpa leaves alone, but the boys father Sam accidentally gives him Tum-Tums suitcase by mistake.

At the tournament, Colt takes the place of a fallen competitor, but is promptly beaten by a girl named Miyo, wounding his pride. She helps them deliver the dagger to the Grand Master, and allows the boys to stay with her and her mother. She has a love of baseball, but is not very good, the boys offer to train her in baseball if she teaches them some of her martial arts skill.</p><p>Koga attempts to trap the boys by pretending to be the Grand Master, but the boys and Miyo catch onto his scheme. They face several adversaries before they are finally captured. Meanwhile Mori is kidnapped from the hospital by Kogas assistant after fleeing Glam and the others.

Soon after, the children come up with a plan and escape Kogas compound on hang gliders, arriving at the cave shortly after the adults. Inside, Koga and Mori realize the legend is true after they encounter walls and monuments of gold within, the boys and Miyo drop in on them and Koga pulls a gun. Using Moris lesson on focus, Colt throws a ball bearing into the muzzle of the gun, causing it to backfire and start a cave in. The group flees the cave, and Koga, now realizing the price of his greed apologizes, and leaves the group unharmed. Rocky realizes that they are a day ahead of America, and that they can still make it home by the championship game.</p>

James White of the UK magazine Empire (magazine)|Empire gave the film 3 of 5 stars, saying, "Rocky with robots? Its not quite in Balboas weight class, but Real Steel at least has some heft.

<h2>2729504.txt: Nighthawks (film): 14.86</h2><p>Reportedly, the original cut of the film was just short of 2 1/2 hours long.  Numerous scenes between Stallone and Wagner, as well as Rutger Hauer and Persis Khambatta, which fleshed out both characters and plot were deleted because Universal wanted a fast-paced action film. Stallone also had a hand in re-editing of the film. He was jealous of Hauer, whose performance he felt dominated the film. Two versions of the film were shown to test audiences, one with more emphasis on Stallones character and the other on Hauers. The version featuring more of Hauers scenes was better received by audiences. Stallone then removed some of Hauers scenes from what became the final version of the film. This has also been confirmed in Frank Sanellos book "Stallone: A Rocky Life".</p><p>"Universal got some old dyke as music editor that had worked on Jaws.

That film – I mean, history has shown that hes so talented in so many different ways. He had made "Rocky" obviously before that. But, it was just incredible. They had some difficulties. Whatever they were, I wasnt privy to the inside information about it. We started with one director, and all of the sudden there was some problems, and Sylvester ended up having to take over the film and he ended up directing it. So just spontaneously, he just jumped into that role, and after that directed it. And, it was incredible watching him and his multi-talented self whip that film into shape. It was quite educational in some ways. But, just kind of awe inspiring watching him work on so many levels at one time. Thats not easy. Not many actors can do that." </p>

<h2>10354167.txt: The Terror Within: 14.86</h2><p>In a post-apocalyptic future, human survivors are fighting a group of mutant monsters they refer to as "Gargoyles". Two of these survivors Michael and John are out surveying the world after a chemical or biological attack which left a large portion of the population mutated or dead.  The survivors are part of the Mojave Lab and have lost contact with their sister Rocky Mountain Lab.  Over the radio Sue and David hear John and Michael fall under attack from the gargoyles while investigating a large group of buzzards.  In order to find John and Michael, David and Linda go out of the bunker but find John and Michael dead.  They also find a live girl named Karen who they bring back to their bunker.  While under anesthesia Karen gives birth to a gargoyle which gets loose in the bunker.  Hal develops a plan to kill the gargoyle in which Andre and Neil fall prey to the gargoyle.  The gargoyle then proceeds to wound David and injure his dog Brutus while also kidnapping Sue with the intentions to reproducing with her.  These creatures reproduce quickly by raping human women and impregnating them.  The gestation period is short and deadly.  The creatures are very strong and able to heal after some wounds such as burning, beating, and electrical shock.  They are vulnerable to the high-pitched frequency of a dog whistle (used by a lead character to ward them off).  Sue becomes impregnated by the gargoyle; she later kills herself via drug overdose.  Linda and David then hatch a plan to kill the gargoyle by luring him into the ventilation system where he becomes trapped and falls into a running exhaust fan dismembering him.  David and Linda re-establish radio contact with the Rocky Mountain Lab and along with Brutus leave the bunker with a high frequency megaphone to brave the outside world.  They lie and wait for a number of gargoyles to enter the open bunker and implode it.  Linda and David leave the bunker; it is implied that they are on their way to the Rocky Mountain Lab.  Abortion becomes a topic of debate between the humans when one of the characters is raped by one of the creatures; they are unsure if the woman is pregnant by her human partner or the monster.</p>
