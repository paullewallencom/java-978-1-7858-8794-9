<h2>2223425.txt:  Cleopatra Jones: 53.03</h2><p><p><p></p><p>Cleopatra "Cleo" Jones (Dobson) is an undercover special agent for the United States Government.  Overseas modeling is only a cover for her real job. Cleo is a Bond-like heroine with power and influence, her silver and black `73 Corvette Stingray (equipped with automatic weapons), and her martial arts ability. While she evokes the glory of a funk goddess, she remains loyal to her drug-ravaged community and her lover, Reuben Masters (Bernie Casey), who runs B&S House (a community home for recovering drug addicts).   </p></p><p>Although Cleopatra Jones contains themes relating specifically to the Black Power and feminist movements, it appeals to the general public and is said to be the “first blaxploitation film to use martial arts as part of its promotion.”    It appeals to audiences who enjoy action movies (such as the James Bond series) and has invited comparisons between Jones and Bond. One critic noted “On the surface, Cleopatra Jones is about a black distaff James Bond who drives a fancy car equipped with a submachine gun in the door, wears smart clothes, is a karate expert, and travels all over the world as a United States secret agent, destroying the poppy wherever it is found.”  Another critic, Chris Norton, even suggested, “Like Bond, Cleo is not a stealthy character who tries to infiltrate the underworld by losing her identity… Bond seldom tried to hide his identity, often using his real name during introductions, and all Bond films rely on his being recognized as 007.”  Likewise, Jones is rarely undercover, and is flashy and flamboyant on the job. Norton continues by saying “Cleo’s outrageous outfits are also analogous with Bond’s dinner jackets and playboy wardrobe. Her three-foot hat brims and flowing fur robes are treated with respect and awe within the film, just as Bond’s refinements are looked upon as the height of good taste…   Cleo is not simply a black James Bond. While the Cleopatra Jones films have co-opted Bond, they avoid a total fusion of her character of Bond.” </p></p><p>Another theme within the film is the Black Power generated “Black is Beautiful” consciousness seen in Jones’s appearance. Although she is seen as a center of attraction and sexuality, she still wears an Afro which signified black affirmation.  Jones’s obscured hair underscores racial difference and departure from the traditional long hair as a sign of white, feminine sexual beauty.  Also, her colorful and flashy outfits were a departure from the more modest, classy appeal of the James Bond hero. These emphasized a departure from the traditional white male hero. Dobson herself believed that her role enabled black beauty to be more visible in mainstream media. She stated, “It’s true there are very few black models. You won’t see them smiling out at you from the covers of major magazines. Editors blame this on the market… but I say forget the market- we’re talking about a pretty girl. I’ve seen oooogly white girls on magazine covers. But black girls must be safe. They must have straight hair, or hair that can be pressed, and they must have Caucasian features.”  Dobson’s role created an entertaining, “safe” ground for black women to retain their ethnic appearances while still being portrayed as strikingly beautiful and powerful. </p>

His old buddy, Colonel McKee (Charles McGraw), tries his best for him, but the base commander, Brigadier General Banner (Lloyd Nolan), turns him down because he cannot trust him to be stable. A complication is that the generals secretary and love interest, Connie Mitchell (Virginia Leith), is an old flame. Bond presses for a job and accepts the generals offer of routine flying in support. Banner is a hands-on leader, taking the most dangerous assignments himself.</p></p><p>When Bond flies the new Gilbert XF-120 fighter, he finds dangerous structural problems that threaten its imminent acceptance by the Air Force. However, nobody really believes his claim that he did not subject the fighter prototype to stresses beyond its design specifications, especially H. G. Gilbert (Ralph Moody), the head of the company that built the fighter. When the general tries to replicate Bonds maneuvers, nothing untoward happens. Afterward, Bond sees Banner nearly collapse in the locker room, but Banner shrugs off the incident.</p>
