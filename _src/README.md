# Mastering Concurrency Programming with Java 9 - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Mastering Concurrency Programming with Java 9 - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/mastering-concurrency-programming-java-9-second-edition?utm_source=GitHub), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
The book starts with a full description of the design principles of concurrent applications and explains how to parallelize a sequential algorithm. You will then be introduced to Threads and Runnables, which are an integral part of Java 9's concurrency API. You will see how to use all the components of the Java concurrency API, from the basics to the most advanced techniques, and will implement them in powerful real-world concurrency applications.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
public void task2() {

  section2_1();

  commonObject2.notify();

  commonObject1.wait();

  section2_2();

} 
```

To follow this book, you need basic to medium-level knowledge of the Java programming language. A basic knowledge of concurrency concepts is welcome too.
